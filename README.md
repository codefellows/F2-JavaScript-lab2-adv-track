1. Make sure you're logged in to your account on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Fork" button in the upper right. This will create a new copy of the repo, one that's associated with your account. This will take you to your account on GitHub - notice that the name in the upper left has changed from "codefellows" to yours, and underneath it should say "forked from codefellows/lab2-adv-track".
3. Copy the link in the "HTTPS Clone URL" box on the right. Tip: that link should have your username in it, not codefellows.
4. Open your terminal and navigate to your projects directory.
5. Run this: `git clone paste-in-that-url-here`
6. `cd F2-JavaScript-lab2-adv-track`
7. Run `npm install`.
8. Your assignment is in lab2.js. There are detailed instructions in the
comments. Be sure to read everything. Run lab2.js with `node lab2.js`.
9. Before you turn in your assignment, run `grunt` to check for jshint and jscs errors/warnings. Fix all the errors.
10. List any resources you used (blogs, Stack Overflow questions, etc.) or collaborators below.


#### Resources and Collaborators

<p>I briefly worked with <strong>Jose Tello, Kuk-Rim Choe, </strong> and had some assistance from <strong> Vi Dang </strong> to help me understand why my scope was throwing off my blob.hoursToOoze function.  That problem caused me significant issues and was / is the reason why this is being turned in late.  I had wanted the blob constructor to have properties of hours spent eating and people eaten, however that was throwing off my asserts as those values were carrying over into the next town (which, you know, if the blob was going to take over the world would be a feature and not a bug... but I digress).  I would be very curious to know how efficient the solution I provided is in overall context, and how I could make it more efficient. 
<p>  For resources I used MDN and W3 Schools to help find information on sort.
